DICOM Image Processing
• Project goal: Utilize machine learning to forecast lung function decline in patients with an incurable lung disease.
• Methodology: Analyze CT scan images of the lungs, along with associated metadata and baseline Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) measurements from a spirometer.
• Predictive model: Predicts the severity of lung function decline to provide clearer prognoses for patients and families at diagnosis.

Music data recognition
• Preprocess GTZAN Dataset for Music Genre Classification.
• Implement Neural Network Model using MFCCs for genre classification with TensorFlow/Keras.
